    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A flavorful,  easy-to-cook steak recipe with simple marinade that ensures the tenderness and juiciness of the meat every time</p>
    <p>The recipe below is for 6 servings. Adjust the ingredients and cooking time according to number of servings</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pound flat iron steak</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place steak in the hot skillet and discard any remaining marinade; sear and cook steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 54 degrees C for medium rare.</li>
        <li>Allow steak to rest for about 5 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
